# liquibase-examples
Here I will be collecting examples of things I do with liquibase. For now, I have a couple of examples:
* Simple use of liquibase Maven plugin to apply changes to a running MySql database.
* Example of how to generate a Docker image containing all changes implemented in the changelogs.
